What do you think the risk is for individuals when their email addresses and passwords are exposed to the public 

In my opinion if your email and password are compromised this allows anyone with both of this information to log onto your account with ease.
They can access personal information as well as sign up for things using your email. 
You can change your password frequently and make sure you use numbers and letters as well as special characters. 
You can always opt into 2 factor authentication as well as use programs designed to keep your passwords encrypted and safe.
